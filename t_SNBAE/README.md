# t_SNBAE
#### Matthew Osborne, joint with Kevin Nowland

The goal of this project is to implement some dimensionality reduction techniques on team shot selection data to see if we can identify different offensive play styles. We have no expectations for this project other than to learn how to implement t-SNE using python.
