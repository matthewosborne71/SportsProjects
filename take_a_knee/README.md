Watching games this past season I found myself interested with kick returns. Since
the startling reveal that repeated hits to the head is bad for one's long term
health, the league has targeted kickoffs as a play of interest. What used to be
as one of the most dangerous plays in football has seen a number of rule changes
over the past several seasons. My interest in this project is to look at how the
play has evolved since 2005.

In this repository you can find all of the python code, as well as the html and
javascript used to write up my findings.

### Python Code
#### get_kicks.py
get_kicks.py is a script I wrote to scrape pro-football reference play by play
data to get all kick off events since the 2005 season.
