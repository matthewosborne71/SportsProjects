# NBA_Shot_Charts
#### Last Updated March 30, 2019

In this project I examined how I could make an NBA Shot Chart using python. I go over how to pull shot chart statisitics using the `nba_api` package, then how to use that data with the `seaborn` and `matplotlib` packages to make various shot charts. This is all detailed within the jupyter notebook file.

Eventually I will write up some Javascript code using D3 to make plots in an HTML page.
