# NBA_Through_The_Years
### Last Update March 30, 2019

In this project I will examine how the NBA has changed over the years. The inspiration comes from Figure 3.1 in Dean Oliver's <u>Basketball on Paper</u>.

We'll be using `BeautifulSoup` to pull data from <a href = "https://www.basketball-reference.com/">Basketball-Reference<\a>. Then we'll handle the data using `pandas`, `numpy`, and visualize it using `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.
